<p>This app shows NASA's latest Image of the Day from their <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/">image gallery</a>. 
If you select the automatic option at the bottom of the app's main screen, your wallpaper will automatically update soon after the new NASA 
Image of the Day is posted. (Don't worry, this is a very lightweight process and doesn't drain your battery!)</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning how to build your own Android apps, be sure to keep a look out for Head First Android Development
(due on store shelves in April 2011). NASA Daily Image is an example app from Head First Android Development, and you can learn how to build it yourself when you read it. 
In the process of learning to build it, you'll learn how to use RSS feeds, make network calls, embed a WebView, work with permissions, layouts and more! </p>
